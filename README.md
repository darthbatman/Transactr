# Transactr
Keep track of how much money you spend when using cash with Transactr.

# Inspiration
Credit cards provide users with credit card statements, something that helps you keep track of everything from where you made a purchase to much money you spent. As high school students, we don't have credit cards, and use cash on a day to day basis, but can't keep track of how much money we spend.

# What it does
We use a pebble inside your wallet to track when your wallet is opened. When it is, you get a text on your phone asking if you made a transaction, and how much you spent, to show you how much cash you are spending, which in turn is relayed on a webapp that shows you where, when, and how much cash you are spending.
